First the breeze came
Like a prophecy.
We all expected it, but
it's arrival wasn't 
less a miracle.

Last we came to the garden
Every water bottle in every hand, 
Was drunk and empty or near empty Was drunk and empty or near empty Was drunk and empty or near empty
Today all the bottles are full

And so are we
